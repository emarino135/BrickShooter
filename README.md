# BrickShooter game
I created this game using Swing and AWT GUI libraries in Java. The game is simple and easy to play. However, it is near impossible
  to win this game because the bricks, which are the bad guys, keep getting generated and moving vertically toward the player's panel
  with the fast pace. The graphic is not that smooth and i believe it needs to be polished because I mainly used geometric shapes to 
  for all objects in the game.
